# Hola
I'm Almer

I learn, I Code

My interests:
- React (Actually I'm using it here https://github.com/sierraleonez/simplr-dashboard)
- Javascript
- Angular
- Golang
- Competitive Programming (I'm totally newbie on this)
- Infra (I'm exploring GCP currently)

I haven't create anything useful by myself, and I wanted to create one.

I also want to join the open source project but idk how.. can anyone tell me?
